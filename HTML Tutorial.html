        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    </center>
    <p><span class="txt1">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</span> is the standard markup language for 
    creating web<br> pages and web applications.</p>
    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and 
    render the documents<br> into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a 
    web page semantically and originally<br> included cues for the appearance of the document.
    </p>
    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and 
    other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML 
    provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for 
    text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements 
    are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> 
    directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information 
    about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the 
    HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
